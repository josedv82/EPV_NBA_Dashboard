# EPV Dashboard
A conceptual dashboard design to visualize Expected Possession Value (EPV) in the NBA.

***

This is a minimal proof of concept dashboard to interact with EPV in Basketball. It provides information at a play by play level for a full game as well as the player total EPV added for the game. Users can open each play to visualize an interactive diagram of the play alongside the EPV at the time.

The app is not intended to work on mobile devices.
